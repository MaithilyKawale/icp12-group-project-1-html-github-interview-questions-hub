        <p><b>Answer 1:</b> 8°. Explanation: The second hand completes a full revolution (360°) in 60 seconds. In 480°,
            the second hand moves for 480°/360° * 60 seconds = 80 seconds. In the same time, the minute hand moves 8°
            (6° per minute). Thus, the minute hand moves 8°.</p>

        <p><b>Answer 2:</b> 180°. Explanation: The hour hand moves 30° per hour (360° / 12 hours). From 8 o'clock to 2
            o'clock, the hour hand moves through 6 hours, thus 6 * 30° = 180°.</p>

        <p><b>Answer 3:</b> 220°. Explanation: The angle between the hour and minute hands at 7:10 can be calculated
            using the formula for angle between hour and minute hands:
            <br>Angle = |(30*hour - (11/2)*minutes)|. At 7:10, the angle is |(30*7) - (11/2)*10| = 210°.
            The reflex angle = 360° - 210° = 220°.
        </p>

        <p><b>Answer 4:</b> 22. Explanation: The hands of the clock coincide 22 times in 24 hours, once every hour and 5
            minutes, except at 12 o'clock.</p>

        <p><b>Answer 5:</b> 22. Explanation: The hour and minute hands are at right angles 22 times in 12 hours. This
            happens approximately once every hour and 5.5 minutes.</p>

        <p><b>Answer 6:</b> 22. Explanation: The clock hands are in opposite directions (i.e., 180° apart) 22 times in
            24 hours.</p>

        <p><b>Answer 7:</b> 192 1/2°. Explanation: At 10:25, the angle between the hands is 167 1/2°, so the reflex
            angle is 360° - 167 1/2° = 192 1/2°.</p>

        <p><b>Answer 8:</b> 125°. Explanation: The minute hand is at the 8th position (240°). The hour hand moves 1/2°
            per minute, and at 3:40, it is 20° from 3 o'clock. So the angle is 240° - 20° = 125°.</p>

        <p><b>Answer 9:</b> 5 2/11 min. past 7. Explanation: At 7:00, the hands are at 210° apart, and they move toward
            each other. To find the exact time, you use the formula: 11/2 * time = 210 + 180. Solving this gives the
            answer.</p>

        <p><b>Answer 10:</b> 43 5/11 min. past 5. Explanation: The hands form a right angle twice in an hour. Between
            5:30 and 6:00, one of these occurrences is at 43 5/11 minutes past 5.</p>
