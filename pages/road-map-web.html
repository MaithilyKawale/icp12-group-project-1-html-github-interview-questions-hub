        It’s hard to know the best way to learn coding, because there are a ton of resources out there. But right now,
        all you need is the basics of web development– a general explanation with some direction on where to go next.

        First, here are the steps that you’ll need to follow as a beginner web developer.
    </p>

    <h3> <b>Steps to learn web development basics:</b></h3>
    1. Learn the basics of how websites work, front-end vs back-end, and using a code editor <br />
    2. Learn basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript <br />
    3. Learn tools: package managers, build tools, version control <br />
    4. Learn Sass, responsive design, JavaScript frameworks <br />
    5. Learn back-end basics: servers and databases, programming languages <br />
    </p>
    <p>
        I recommend doing Steps 1, 2, and 3 in order. Then, depending on whether you want to focus on more front-end or
        back-end, you can do steps 4a or 4b in any order.
        I personally think it’s good idea for front-end web developers to know at least a bit of back-end, and vice
        versa. At the very least, learning the basics of both will help you figure out if you like front-end or back-end
        web development better
