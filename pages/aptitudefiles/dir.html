        <p><b>Answer 1:</b>
            By plotting positions step-by-step:
            - B is 5 m east of A.
            - C is 8 m north of B.
            - D is 3 m west of C.
            - E is 10 m south of D.
            - F is 6 m west of E.
            - G is 4 m north of F.
            This creates a connected path showing relative positions.
        </p>

        <p><b>Answer 2:</b>
            After walking 10 m east, 7 m north, 5 m west, and 7 m south, the person’s final position is 5 m east of
            start.
            So, distance from starting point = 5 meters.
        </p>

        <p><b>Answer 3:</b>
            Y is 9 m east of X, Z is 5 m west of Y.
            So, distance between X and Z = 9 m - 5 m = 4 meters.
        </p>

        <p><b>Answer 4:</b>
            Sitting arrangement around the table:
            - M opposite P.
            - N immediate left of M.
            - Q immediate right of P.
            - R opposite N.
            This helps deduce positions for seating order and relative sides.
        </p>

        <p><b>Answer 5:</b>
            After walking 12 m north, 5 m east, 12 m south, and 5 m east, the person ends up 10 m east of starting
            point.
            Distance from start = 10 meters.
        </p>

        <p><b>Answer 6:</b>
            Points A and B are 20 m apart on a straight road.
            Points C and D are each 15 m north of A and B respectively.
            Distance between C and D = same as distance between A and B = 20 meters.
        </p>

        <p><b>Answer 7:</b>
            The boy’s final position is 8 m east and 4 m south of start.
            Distance from start = √(8² + 4²) = √(64 + 16) = √80 ≈ 8.94 meters.
        </p>

        <p><b>Answer 8:</b>
            Positions along road:
            - Q is 10 m east of P.
            - R is 6 m west of Q (4 m east of P).
            - S is 4 m east of R (8 m east of P).
            - T is 2 m west of P.
            Distance between S and T = 8 m east - 2 m west = 10 meters.
        </p>

        <p><b>Answer 9:</b>
            The person walks 8 m north, 6 m west, and 8 m south.
            Final position is 6 m west of starting point.
            Distance from start = 6 meters.
        </p>

        <p><b>Answer 10:</b>
            Row order from left to right (facing north) is: E, D, C, B, A.
            So, B is standing in the middle.
