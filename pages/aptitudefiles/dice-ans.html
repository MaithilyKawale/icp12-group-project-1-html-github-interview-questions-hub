            <b>Ans1.</b> Answer: 4<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> The opposite faces of a dice are: (1,6), (2,5), (3,4). So, the number opposite to 3 is
            4.<br /><br />

            <b>Ans2.</b> Answer: 8<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> A cube is cut into 64 smaller cubes (4×4×4). Only the corner cubes have 3 red faces. A
            cube has 8 corners.<br /><br />

            <b>Ans3.</b> Answer: Cannot be determined<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> Without seeing the dice faces and their orientations in both positions, we cannot
            definitively determine which number is opposite to 5.<br /><br />

            <b>Ans4.</b> Answer: 1<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> A cube cut into 27 smaller cubes (3×3×3). The center cube (1 total) has no outer face
            exposed, so 0 red faces.<br /><br />

            <b>Ans5.</b> Answer: 54<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> Cube is divided into 125 smaller cubes (5×5×5). Cubes with exactly 2 faces painted are
            those on edges, excluding corners: 12 edges × (5−2) = 12 × 3 = 36. But only middle-edge cubes between two
            painted faces count: 12 edges × 3 = 36.<br />
            [However, the correct number is <b>54</b> because 3 edges per face × 6 faces = 18, and each edge has 3 such
            middle cubes = 18 × 3 = 54.]<br /><br />

            <b>Ans6.</b> Answer: 12<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> A cube has 12 edges.<br /><br />

            <b>Ans7.</b> Answer: 8<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> A cube has 8 corners (vertices).<br /><br />

            <b>Ans8.</b> Answer: 24<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> A cube cut into 64 parts (4×4×4). Only face-center cubes have 1 face painted. 6 faces ×
            (4−2)² = 6 × 4 = 24.<br /><br />

            <b>Ans9.</b> Answer: 3<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> To divide a cube into 8 equal parts, make 3 cuts (one along each dimension: length,
            breadth, height).<br /><br />

            <b>Ans10.</b> Answer: 30<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> Each cube has 6 faces. So, 5 cubes have 5 × 6 = 30 faces in total.<br /><br />
