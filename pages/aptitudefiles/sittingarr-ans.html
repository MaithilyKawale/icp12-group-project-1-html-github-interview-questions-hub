            <b>Ans1.</b> Answer: B<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> B is to the left of C but to the right of A, so the order is A, B, C. Including D and E,
            the arrangement can be A, B, C, D, E. Hence, C is in the middle.<br /><br />

            <b>Ans2.</b> Answer: S<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> T is to the right of Q, so the arrangement could be ... Q - T ... P is to the left of Q.
            R is between S and T. Arranging these hints in a circular way, S ends up opposite to P.<br /><br />

            <b>Ans3.</b> Answer: A<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> A is between C and B, so the arrangement is C, A, B. In a row of 7, the center is the
            4th position. Placing this group accordingly, A lands in the center.<br /><br />

            <b>Ans4.</b> Answer: S<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> T
            < S < R and Q is at the extreme right. The possible order is T, S, R, ?, Q. The middle position (3rd) is
                S.<br /><br />

            <b>Ans5.</b> Answer: P<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> If P is between S and T in a circle, then the person to the immediate right of T is
            P.<br /><br />

            <b>Ans6.</b> Answer: A<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> D is at one end, E at the other. C is between A and B, so one possible order is D, A, C,
            B, E. Hence, A is second from the left.<br /><br />

            <b>Ans7.</b> Answer: East<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> Q faces north. Second to the right of Q is East. So, P is sitting on Q’s east, and faces
            the same direction → East.<br /><br />

            <b>Ans8.</b> Answer: 4<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> In a circle of 8, there are 4 pairs sitting exactly opposite each other. (8 ÷ 2 = 4
            pairs).<br /><br />

            <b>Ans9.</b> Answer: R<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> Facing south: Left and right are reversed. So R is between T and S. Hence, R is in the
            middle.<br /><br />

            <b>Ans10.</b> Answer: Cannot be determined<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> A is opposite D, B is between A and C, but F’s position isn't clearly linked with
            others. So, the person to F’s right cannot be determined.<br /><br />
