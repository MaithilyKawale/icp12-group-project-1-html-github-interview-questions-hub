            <b>Ans1.</b> Answer: Only conclusion is true<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> Given: A > B = C ≥ D
            < E<br />
            From this: A > B = C ≥ D → A > D is definitely true.<br /><br />

            <b>Ans2.</b> Answer: Cannot be determined<br />
            <b>Explanation:</b> P ≥ Q > R ≤ S < T. The relation between P and S is not clear, since R ≤ S and R is less
                than Q. So P> S cannot be concluded definitely.<br /><br />

                <b>Ans3.</b> Answer: Definitely true<br />
                <b>Explanation:</b> M < N=O ≥ P> Q<br />
                    From this: N = O ≥ P > Q → N > Q is definitely true.<br /><br />

                    <b>Ans4.</b> Answer: True<br />
                    <b>Explanation:</b> W = X ≥ Y > Z<br />
                    Since W = X and X ≥ Y > Z → So W > Z is definitely true ⇒ Z
                    < W is true.<br /><br />

                    <b>Ans5.</b> Answer: True<br />
                    <b>Explanation:</b> A ≥ B > C = D
                    < E<br />
                    From this: A ≥ B > C = D → A > D is true as A is greater than B, which is greater than
                    D.<br /><br />
