        effectively on projects.
    </p>

    <h3>3. What are your weaknesses?</h3>
    <p>
        One area I am working on is public speaking. I sometimes feel nervous while speaking in front of large groups,

    </p>

    <h3>4. Why should we hire you?</h3>
    <p>
        I have a solid technical background and a strong passion for software development. I am hardworking, 
        eager to learn, and dedicated to delivering quality results. I believe I can contribute to your team’s 
        success through my skills and enthusiasm.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Where do you see yourself in 5 years?</h3>
